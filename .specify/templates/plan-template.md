# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify alignment with TicTacToe Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Feature scope allows functions ≤50 lines
- [ ] Complexity manageable (cyclomatic complexity ≤10)
- [ ] No obvious duplication or magic numbers planned
- [ ] Code review process defined

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test-first approach planned (Red-Green-Refactor)
- [ ] Test scenarios documented in spec
- [ ] 80% coverage target achievable
- [ ] Test pyramid strategy defined (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e)
- [ ] Performance: Unit tests <5s, full suite <60s

### User Experience Standards (for user-facing features)
- [ ] Response time targets defined (<100ms actions, <1s page loads, <200ms API p95)
- [ ] Error handling strategy documented
- [ ] Accessibility requirements specified (keyboard nav, screen readers, 4.5:1 contrast)
- [ ] Responsive design planned (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Memory budget defined (<50MB for game state)
- [ ] Algorithm complexity acceptable (O(1) or O(n))
- [ ] AI move calculation target <500ms
- [ ] No blocking operations on main thread

### Documentation & Maintainability
- [ ] Architecture approach documented
- [ ] API documentation plan defined
- [ ] Complex decisions explained with rationale

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
